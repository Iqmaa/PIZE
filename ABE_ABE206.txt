1.0 INTRODUCTION TO AGRICUTURAL AND BIOSYSTEMS
ENGINEERING DISCIPLINE
1.1 DEFINITION
Engineering – This is the profession in which knowledge of the
mathematical, physical and biological sciences gained by study experience
and practice is applied in the efficient use of materials and forces of nature
for the benefit of man and the environment.
Agriculture – Encompasses the art, science and industry of managing the
growth of plants and animals for the benefit of man. It includes the
production of crops and rearing of livestock including fishes; their
processing to varied degrees and products; and marketing of their end
products.
Agricultural Engineering – The application of engineering and
technology and the physical biological sciences in agricultural production.
It requires the application of knowledge from other branches of
engineering to the extent that such knowledge may be used in solving
engineering problems of agriculture in all ramifications and in rural living.
The principal objective of Agricultural Engineering is to provide
appropriate modern equipment, technology and conducive environment
2
for agricultural production, processing and storage.This ensures improved
productivity, profitability and sustainability of the enterprise. Through
agricultural engineering, the following are achieved:
(a) Reduction in the hazards of farming operations
(b) Reduction of drudgery in agricultural productions
(c) Moderation of seasonality of agricultural produce
availability by development of systems that protect
production from vagaries of weather.
(d) Continuous development and improvement of equipment
and technologies for production, processing and storage
(e) Enhancement of quality of life and financial security for
farming families and enterprises.
(f) National self-sufficiency in food supply and raw materials
for agro-based industries.
(g) Sustainability of the environment for agricultural
production systems
A good agricultural engineer must be knowledgeable to an appropriate level, in
most aspects of engineering disciplines and have interest in working in rural,
semi-urban and peri-urban settings.
1.2 SPECIALIZATION/ OPTIONS IN AGRICULTURAL AND
BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
Agricultural Engineering profession worldwide focuses its attention on six ( 6)
main areas, namely:
1.2.1 Aquacultural Engineering
Aquaculture engineering is the branch of agricultural engineering that studies
cultured aquatic species and the production systems used in their culture. Study,
research and development in this area ranges from low intensity man-made pond
systems to highly intensive recirculation systems involving natural lakes. Species
cultured in these systems could range from warm to cold water fish and from
fresh to sea water .This is an important aspect of agriculture in fishery. In modern
day fishery, either in ponds, rivers, or the oceans, a variety of machines are used
for raising, catching and processing fish. Aquacultural Engineering delas with the
structures and machines required for various fishery operations.
3
1.2.2 Processing and Storage Engineering
Agricultural processing and storage is another branch of Agricultural Engineering.
In this course, it will be considered in two categories, namely: Agricultural
Processing and Storage of agricultural products. Agricultural processing can
further be divided into crop processing and food processing. Crop processing is
any procedure or treatment that prepares farm products for utilization or
preservation. Food processing, however, is the process of physically or
chemically converting the crops into a form that could easily be cooked or eaten.
Stoarge can be defined as the art and science of keeping of crops in good
condition in a safe place until usage time or consumption time.
1.2.3 Power and Machinery Engineering
This branch of Agricultural Engineering deals with the area of farm
mechanization. Farm mechanization is defined as the application of engineering
principles and technology in agricultural production, processing and storage.
Agricultural mechanization is a wider term used when these activities extend
beyond the boundaries of the farm unit. Farm mechanization is not only
tractorization but a process of improving farming operations and farm structures.
The major role of power units in the farm is to operate farm equipment for land
clearing and development, cultivation, harvesting, processing, handling,
transporting, loading, unloading, pumping and any other farm operations. The use
of farm machinery in Nigerian agriculture is gaining popularity because of the
increasing awareness to large- scale farming.
1.2.4 Structures and Environment Engineering
This branch of Agricultural Engineering deals with the planning, design and
construction of farmstead and controlled environments for production, storage and
processing. Farmstead structures include animal housing units, farm dwellings
and produce structures. Examples of closed controlled-environment systems are
silos, rhumbus and green houses.
1.2.5 Soil and Water Engineering
Soil and water engineering is that branch of agricultural engineering where
engineering principles are applied in solving problems associated with managing
soil and water resources. The aim of soil conservation is to protect the soil from
degradation which may result from the effect of water, wind and improper land
use practices Soil and water conservation may involve modified tillage and crop
management practices . It could include mulching using artificial and natural
materials, contouring and terracing. Conservation of soil water may also involve
engineered systems for improving soil profile water storage.
4
Drainage is an aspect of soil and water engineering dealing with the removal of
excess water from surface and subsurface of the field. Irrigation is also an aspect
of soil and water engineering dealing with the application of water to the field so
that crop production is not hampered by water stress. It is required when
precipitation is either not available or is insufficient to meet crop water
requirement.
Water conveyance systems may also consist of pipelines and canals. Field water
application systems vary in levels of sophistication. They include wild flooding,
engineered surface and overhead application system.

1.5 RELEVANT PROFESSIONAL BODIES IN AGRICULTURAL AND
BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
A Professional Regulatory Body is a body established by a decree or an act of the
legislative arm of Government and its primary function is to regulate the training
of members of the profession and the professional practice. Such regulatory body
for the Agricultural Engineering and other Engineering professions in Nigeria is
the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN). A practicing
agricultural engineer must be registered by the Council for the Regulation of
Engineering in Nigeria (COREN).A professional Society is an association formed
by members of the profession with the primary objectives of providing a forum
where members of the profession can interact to share ideas. Such professional
societies are Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), Nigerian Institution of
Agricultural Engineers (NIAE), West African Society of Agricultural Engineers
(WASAE) and American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (
ASABE). The Nigerian Society of Engineers is the umbrella association for all
11
